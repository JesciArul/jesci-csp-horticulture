 Our Community Service Project focuses on the field of <strong>Horticulture</strong>, which plays a vital role in rural livelihoods,
      food production, and economic sustainability. The main aim of our project is to raise awareness about modern horticultural
      practices, support local farmers and gardeners, and document the current state of horticulture in our community.Through our fieldwork in Kodur, SPSR Nellore District, we interacted with nursery owners, and residents
      involved in home gardening. We gathered insights on the types of fruits, vegetables, and flowers cultivated, the use of organic
      methods, water management techniques, and challenges faced by growers.
